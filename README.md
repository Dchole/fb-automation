# How to setup

## Install packages

Run `npm install` to install all packages

_**!** `Puppeteer` is a huge package and takes long to install_

## Set Facebook Account Details

- Create a `.env.local` file
- Copy the text from `.env.example` file into the `.env.local` you created
- Fill the details

## Start Script

- Run `npm start` to start script
- If you want to run script in dev mode run `npm run dev`

_**NOTE !!!** The facebook feed is very dynamic. It only renders posts when the you're almost at the bottom of the page. Therefore, when you start the script, don't interrupt the process unless you want it to stop_
